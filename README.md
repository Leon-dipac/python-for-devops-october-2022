## Create a project scaffold

  * Create development environment that is cloud-based : 
  
    ### Colab Notebook :
    
    This is an example of how to use [colab] (https://github.com/Leon-dipac/python-for-devops-october-2022/blob/main/getting_started_with_python.ipynb)
    
    ### GitHub Codespaces : This is a paid service under the GitHub Account.
    
    Build out python project scaffold :
    
    * Create a ' Makefile '
    * create a ' requirements.txt '
    * Create a ' test_library.py '
    * python_library
    * Dockerfile
    * command-line-tools
    * Microservices


    ### AWS CloudShell : It's an alternative cloud environment to GitHub Codespaces
    
    ### AWS Cloud9 : It's an alternative cloud environment to GitHub Codespaces. You can just set up your Cloud9 environment 
    with a 't2.micro' with Amazon Linux AMI.
    
    Name of the environment : " python-devops-october-2022 "
    Description of the environment : " This is for coding with Python. "
    
    Once your Cloud9 environment is created then run the following command :

## Command -Lines Tools

## Microservices

## Containerized Continuous Delivery
